regex-repo
==========

A regular expression repository for natural history collection data.

My goal is to create a repository of regular expressions that are focused on parsing strings commonly found in records of natural history collections. There are many regex repositories avaiable on the web but this repository will not only focus on the most relevant expressions, but will also include documentation and tests to verify each regular expression.

This project is in a very early stage and will rely on the contributions of regexperts (hello iDigBio Hackathoners).
